# Background Info
## Food Safety/Restaurant Inspections
[Understanding Food Establishment Inspections](https://doh.dc.gov/service/understanding-food-establishment-inspections)

Food establishments that sell or serve food to the public must apply for a health permit and be inspected for compliance with the DC Department of Health. These establishments include restaurants, school cafeterias, bakeries, mobile food vendors, and markets. The majority of the permitted food service establishments in Washington, DC receive two routine unannounced food safety inspections per year. DOH follows the federal food code and only closes an establishment for critical violations that cannot be corrected while an inspector is onsite (for several hours) and poses immediate harm to residents and visitors to the District. The purpose of a food safety inspection is to ensure the food is being handled properly from preparation through serving. DOH seeks understanding as to whether or not there are common factors of establishments that can guide future training efforts for business owners and staff or that may help the department allocate staff resources in a more efficient and effective manner. Note that the number of times annually that a food retail location is inspected is based on its risk category.Any problems observed are recorded on the inspection report and the manager is taught the correct procedure or method immediately

## The goals for our project

* Data analysis/visualizations of the DOH restaurant inspection data report
* Develop a model featuring relationships between location, risk category, serious food-safety violations, closure etc.
* Develop an application for DOH staff that tracks upcoming inspections, displays information on expiring licenses, and aids in the efficient prioritization of follow-up inspections.
